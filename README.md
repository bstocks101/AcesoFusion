# AcesoFusion
Plugin developed for the OsiriX or Horos environment to view orthogonal MPR slices generated from ultrasound and x-ray data.
Performs an orthogonal reslice of the 3-dimensional ultrasound data and then co-registers each of those views with the x-ray data.
Provides ROI annotation to display the corresponding locations on all 4 image planes.

This is a preliminary version of the plugin developed exclusively for Horos, the final version (currently undergoing certification)
has been ported to the OsiriX MD framework and is property of CapeRay Medical.
